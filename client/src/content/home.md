## Our Mission

Founded in 2025, the Nu Art Film Club seeks to revive the Nuart Theatreâ€™s historic role in entertaining the local community with that great American art form: cinema. Our mission is to educate our viewers in discernment regarding the art of motion pictures, to interpret cultural narratives and iconography with thoughtfulness, testing the ways of the world against the culture of Christ.

## What We Offer

**Monthly Screenings**: carefully selected films, whether contemporary or timeless classics, Christian or secular.

**Discussion Groups**: Post-screening conversations led by scholars and enthusiasts

## The Venue

The Nuart Theatre was built in 1935 on main street in Moscow, Idaho, by Milburn Kenworthy, a figure noted in the community for his contributions to local entertainment. Over the decades the Nuart building has hosted a variety of community services: everything from a vegan juice bar, a Christian bookstore, several churches, and New Saint Andrews college. In 2019 Nate Wilson and Aaron Rench, working with Harby + Points Design, received the local Orchid Award for renovating the building while preserving some of its original Art Deco spirit. The theatre has around 360 seats.
