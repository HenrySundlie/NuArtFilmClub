# Content

One file per text block, written in Markdown. This keeps content simple to edit and version, and renders cleanly in the app.

## Current files

- `home.md` â€” Home page body content.

## Editing

1. Open the relevant `.md` file.
2. Write content in standard Markdown (headings, lists, links, emphasis, etc.).
3. Save. The site will render the updated Markdown automatically.

## Conventions

- Use semantic headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) to structure the page.
- Keep one Markdown file per page/section. Suggested names: `home.md`, `about.md`, `contact.md`.
- Images: use absolute `/images/...` paths for assets in `public/images`.

## Notes

We removed the previous `homePageContent.txt` and `homePageContent.json` in favor of Markdown for readability and portability.
