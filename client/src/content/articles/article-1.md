Gazing back across the endless expanse of the wine-dark sea, Odysseus catches glimpses of a time he can barely recollect: a time when there was a home to defend and when he believed in what he was fighting for. Most of his brothers are dead, and his family’s fidelity is uncertain—he feels as though he’s been robbed of his own children. The leader of his coalition is a traitor doomed to a bad end, and foreigners dwell in Odysseus’ own house, disdaining his return and leeching off his household.

Odysseus is a contemporary of ours. He is not a modern man, nor a postmodern. He is an ancient man, and so are we. We are all ancient men cursed to live in a world of chaos. We long for home, a home we’ve not seen in what feels like lifetimes. Yet there seems to be a guarantee that, regardless of the cost, regardless of the pain, grief, and loss of our compatriots along the way, we will make it there. The promise glimmers through despair, and we row on.

Over the last few weeks information and images have leaked for director Christopher Nolan’s upcoming adaptation of The Odyssey, and the reactions have been mixed at best. On the one hand, you have the endless hordes of Nolan sycophants who believe he can do no wrong and that every move is a legitimate artistic choice to serve the greater story. On the other, you have the history nerds and general online right who are more than skeptical of anything Hollywood serves up, and for good reason. I must identify with the latter half, who believes Nolan has fallen off hard. The problems in what we have seen so far fall into two areas: disregard for historical accuracy and tired DEI casting.

There is a massive problem in modern Hollywood with color. Cinema used to depict medieval times in the vibrant colors they actually had. Now, every film is inaccurate grayscale mudslop. A prime example is the difference between the 1944 Henry V and The King in 2019. “But the latter is more gritty and realistic!” To that I reply, no. The former is accurate. Realism ceases to be meaningful when it is set in opposition to the actual armor Henry actually wore at the battle of Agincourt, which the 1944 film depicts correctly.



This concept, unfathomable to the liberal mind, is foundational to the entire myth of the Dark Ages. It is a projection of how these people must have lived based on the fact that we despise them. They could not have been noble (see the atrocious 2010 Robin Hood starring Russel Crowe), they could not have been righteous (see Ridley Scott’s 2005 Kingdom of Heaven), and they most certainly could not have been masculine, but must be henpecked by the longhouse (see 2023’s Napoleon, also Ridley Scott). Disney’s 1973 Robin Hood is, in some respects, more true to life than all of these. The colorful world and persistent love and joy through difficult circumstances display something that ancient and medieval man believed which modernity will do all in its power to suppress. For these reasons it’s in my top three Disney films, and I may have to review it sometime.

Beyond the color, there are two possibilities when it comes to making an aesthetically faithful adaptation of the Homeric epics. Basically, will they be depicted when the war actually occurred in the 12th century BC, or when Homer recorded them in the 8th century? The former would reflect archeologically founded ancient Mycenaean artifacts, and the latter is what Homer and his Greek audience would likely be imagining when telling the story. Either style (which are vastly different!) are therefore reasonable and legitimate options.




But Christopher Nolan opts for neither. What we have instead is a total rejection of Bronze age armor (both eras would have been shiny and golden, which Homer frequently describes). Beauty was no small consideration for ancient cultures, especially those as prosperous as the Mycenaeans. The warriors are glorious and so is their paraphernalia. But Nolan’s aesthetics are ahistorical to any time period and all over the place: From massive armored boots to Agamemnon’s 3D printed plastic cowl that looks like it lost its way from a Marvel set. Tom Holland wears trousers as Telemachus. Leather is everywhere in place of bronze, and Odysseus’ gear is trying (unsuccessfully) to obtain its Roman citizenship at a great price. Perhaps the laziest and most insulting element of Nolan’s “realism” here is Odysseus’ ship—which is literally a refitted replica of a viking longboat. There is virtually no similarity between such a craft and the pentaconters (or any other galleys) the Greeks employed. Some have pointed out the most coherent explanation for these aesthetics is that perhaps Nolan subscribes to the Baltic Odyssey theory, which sets the story above Europe!




Worse than the technically ahistorical aesthetics is the intentionally subversive casting. Of course, every character in the epics, unless otherwise specified, should be Aegean-Greek. Within stylistic bounds one could reasonably cast white people generally for such parts, and historically Hollywood has done so, although an even better cast would be faithful to the Mediterranean’s inhabitants. Nolan pulls what every film has done for the past fifteen years with the most racially “inclusive” cast he can find. Helen is black. Athena is played by Zendaya (the famously bad black actress from Spiderman, Dune, and basically every other film of the last decade). The transsexual Ellen Page plays an undisclosed character (my bet is on the Cyclops). Odysseus’ crew looks more like they’ve been pulled from Minneapolis than Mycenaeae (we wuz Ithacans!), with a fair number of Indian H-1Bs on board too. It is a tired continuation of the anti-white messaging we have come to expect from Hollywood, the media at large, and those behind them.

I have enjoyed several Christopher Nolan films, and think his mind-bending tropes can work. Inception pulled off a complicated concept well, and though it required the audience to think, it really did make sense. I can’t say the same for Tenet, though part of me still wants to believe it would make sense if I really sat down to map it out. What really made Inception and Interstellar impact where Tenet failed is that both of those films did not rest thematically on the sci-fi concepts, but on the characters and their relationships. That’s not true of Tenet, in which the characters took a complete backseat as Nolan drove the car into a tree. Being Tenet, unfortunately he was driving backward so the characters still took the brunt of the impact.




That’s to say that The Odyssey technically has the potential to be enjoyable if the characters are played well and the themes from the book are maintained in spite of the poor production decisions. But I’m not optimistic. When it comes to the story, Nolan said that it’s highly influenced by Emily Wilson’s “translation,” which puts the first line as, “tell me about a complicated man.” The very loose translation generally translates positive attributes of the character in a negative light, resulting in a bland modern cliche of the washed up male who is unsure of himself. I have my doubts if Nolan has ever taken the time to read a real translation, so I’m not expecting phenomenal work in the story department.

Odysseus may not be a Christian, but he is far too close to one for the modern antihumans. He loves his family, he defends his honor, and he wants to preserve his legacy while honoring his father. He is a virtuous man in the classical sense and worthy of emulation. Thus, he is hated and his story must be tarnished. Every element of classical heritage, every hero, and every hint of nobility or achievement must be squashed into a depressing smudge blighting the last lights off the black West. Like Odysseus, we’re tired. The fatigue has set in.

But it is not hopeless, because we are being cured. The bread and circuses we’ve been fed no longer work. As I saw someone observe astutely, you can’t satisfy with those when the bread is poisoned and the circus calls you racist. What they were always correct about, and that conservatives failed to recognize, is that you do need people like you to identify with. When the only people like you are the villains in every story, you will begin to identify with them. And you might even conclude that maybe, just maybe, they aren’t the villains after all. They might be closer to being your people than the ones the storytellers want to celebrate—because they were intended to represent you in the first place.

We, like the tagline of Nolan’s Odyssey, defy the gods. But the ones we defy are those of modernity: we defy the gods of Christopher Nolan. We defy the gods of Hollywood and the media. We defy the gods of secular liberalism. We serve the sovereign God who will direct our ship safely home. We are, in the words of Spenser,

Much like, as when the beaten marinere,

That long hath wandred in the Ocean wide,

Oft soust in swelling Tethys saltish teare,

And long time having tand his tawney hide

With blustring breath of heaven, that none can bide,

And scorching flames of fierce Orions hound,°

Soone as the port from farre he has espide,

His chearefull whistle merrily doth sound,

And Nereus crownes with cups; his mates him pledg around.
